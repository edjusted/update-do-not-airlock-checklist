# update-do-not-airlock-checklist
Script(s) to make it easy to import/copy over your info from your old (Star Trek Timelines) Do Not Airlock checklist to the new one when there's an update.

If you play Star Trek Timelines, there is a Google Sheets tool available called the Do Not Airlock checklist.
The checklist is available here: https://forum.disruptorbeam.com/stt/discussion/15561/do-not-airlock-checklist-thread-4/p1

The Google Sheet is updated frequently, and it can be time-consuming to copy over all of your data from your old Google Sheet to the new one.
This/these script(s) help make the process of copying over your data automatic.
